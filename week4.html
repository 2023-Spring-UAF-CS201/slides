`if` statements

___  


```C++ 
if (condition /* is a boolean*/) {

  // executes if condition is true

}
```

___  


```C++ 
if (condition /* is a boolean*/) {

  // executes if condition is true

} else {

  // executes if condition is false

}
```

___


```C++ 
if (condition1 /* is a boolean */) {

  // executes if condition1 is true

} else if (condition2 /* is also a boolean */ {

  // executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true

}
```

___


```C++ 
if (condition1 /* is a boolean */) {

  // executes if condition1 is true

} else if (condition2 /* is also a boolean */ {

  // executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true

} else {

  // executes if condition1 and condition 2 are both false

}
```


---

`while` loop

___


```C++
while (condition /* is a boolean */) {

// 1) condition is evaluated
// 2) if condition is true, body of loop executes once
// 3) go back to step 1

}
```

___


```C++
do {

// 1) body of loop runs once
// 2) condition is evaluated
// 3) if condition is true, go back to step 1

} while (condition /* is a boolean */)
```


---

`for` loop

___


```C++
for (/* initialize */; condition; /* update */) {

// 1) code to initialize a variable is evaluated
// 2) condition is evaluated
// 3) if condition is true, body of loop executes once
// 4) code to update the variable is evaluated
// 5) go back to step 2

}

```

---

`vector`

___

`vector` is a complex data type

___

Must import `vector` libary to use

___

A `vector` is a list of element

___

In C++, the elements in a `vector` must all be the same type

___

When you create a `vector`, you manually specify a type

___

```C++
vector&lt;int&gt; my_ints;

// Creates an empty vector of integers
```

___

```C++
vector&lt;int&gt; my_ints{1,2,3,17,-50,100};

// Creates a vector of integers
```
