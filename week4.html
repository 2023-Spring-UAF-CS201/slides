`if` statements

___  


```C++ 
if (condition /* is a boolean*/) {

  // executes if condition is true

}
```

___  


```C++ 
if (condition /* is a boolean*/) {

  // executes if condition is true

} else {

  // executes if condition is false

}
```

___


```C++ 
if (condition1 /* is a boolean */) {

  // executes if condition1 is true

} else if (condition2 /* is also a boolean */ {

  // executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true

}
```

___


```C++ 
if (condition1 /* is a boolean */) {

  // executes if condition1 is true

} else if (condition2 /* is also a boolean */ {

  // executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true

} else {

  // executes if condition1 and condition 2 are both false

}
```


---

`while` loop

___


```C++
while (condition /* is a boolean */) {

// 1) condition is evaluated
// 2) if condition is true, body of loop executes once
// 3) go back to step 1

}
```

___


```C++
do {

// 1) body of loop runs once
// 2) condition is evaluated
// 3) if condition is true, go back to step 1

} while (condition /* is a boolean */)
```


---

`for` loop

___


```C++
for (/* initialize */; condition; /* update */) {

// 1) code to initialize a variable is evaluated
// 2) condition is evaluated
// 3) if condition is true, body of loop executes once
// 4) code to update the variable is evaluated
// 5) go back to step 2

}

```
